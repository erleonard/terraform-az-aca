This example uses AzAPI terraform provider to deploy Azure Container Apps.

## Introduction

## Usage

## What is the AzAPI terraform provider?

The AzAPI provider is a very thin layer on top of the Azure ARM REST APIs. Use this new provider to authenticate to - and manage - Azure resources and functionality using the Azure Resource Manager APIs directly. This provider compliments the Azure Resource Manager provider (AzureRM provider) by enabling the management of Azure resources that are not yet or might never be supported in the AzureRM provider, such as private and public preview services and features.
